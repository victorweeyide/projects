Description and Game Logic of Pygame Projects:

Catching

Two players move around the screen to touch reward items spawning in order to earn points. Each item touched is worth a point. The controls for the first player are W, A, S and D keys. The controls for the second player are the up, down, left and right arrow keys. The player with more points when the timer counts down to zero wins.  

Dodge

The player earns a point every second. The up, down, left and right arrow keys are used to move the player to avoid ball obstacles moving across the screen from all four directions. A candy moves across the screen from a random direction and can be caught by the player to earn five points. A dash charges every two seconds. If the dash is ready, the player will dash a short distance in the direction it is moving in. If the player comes into contact with a ball, the game is over.

Gravity

The player has to dodge obstacles moving towards him both on the ground and in the air. To dodge the obstacles on the ground, the player uses the up arrow key to jump over the obstacle. To dodge the obstacles in the air, the player uses the down arrow key to duck under the obstacle. The player earns points as the timer increases but loses a life when he collides with any obstacles. The game ends when the player has no more lives left. 

Platform

The player has to jump from the ground onto platforms, some of which are moving, using the up, down, left and right arrow keys, in order to win by landing on the fixed leftmost platform.  

Pong

Two players – one controlling the left paddle using the W and S keys, and one controlling the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys – can move their own paddle up and down. A ball starts moving from the centre of the screen in a diagonal direction. When the ball hits a paddle, or the top or bottom of the screen, it bounces at an angle of 90 degrees. If the ball exits the left of the screen, the right player earns a point and the ball resets to the centre. If the ball exits the right of the screen, the left player earns a point and the ball also resets to the centre. 

Shooter 

The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move left and right and the space key to fire at enemy spaceships moving downwards from the top of the screen that spawns every three seconds. If the player successfully shoots down an enemy spaceship, the player earns a point. If the player instead collides with the enemy spaceship, the player loses health. If the enemy spaceship passes through the bottom of the screen without getting shot down or colliding with the player, more enemy spaceships will spawn in the next wave. The game ends when the player has no more health left.
